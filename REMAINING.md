# Phase 9 â€“ Outstanding Work

This list summarizes the remaining tasks from `PLAN9.md` that still need attention before Phase 9 can be considered complete. It reflects the current repository state (Phase 9 in progress).

## Workstream 9A â€“ Conformance Test Suite
- [x] Table-driven SPEC Â§12.1 fixture harness (`jac-codec/tests/conformance.rs`) that exercises multiple datasets (DONE for single fixture; still need matrix/report tooling).
- [x] Multi-level validation (columnar/segment inspection) per SPEC Â§4.7.
- [x] Schema drift corpus + tests.
- [x] Cross-platform/endianness/version-compat runs (currently only unit coverage for `UnsupportedVersion`).
- [x] Additional edge fixtures: deeply nested objects, high-precision decimals, empty/single-record files, >100k synthetic blocks.
- [x] Conformance test runner + report generator and documentation updates (`SPEC-COMPLIANCE.md`).
- [x] Concurrency stress suite to exercise parallel writers/readers.

## Workstream 9B â€“ Fuzzing & Property Testing
- [x] Flesh out `cargo-fuzz` targets beyond `fuzz_decode_block`/`fuzz_varint` (projection, CLI, grammar/differential fuzzing, mutation campaigns).
- [x] Add `proptest`-based invariants for varint/bitpack/decimal routines.
- [x] Corpus management, crash triage, coverage-guided runs, and CI/nightly orchestration.

## Workstream 9C â€“ Error Regression Harness
- [x] Keep mapping remaining `JacError` variants (Io on reader open, Json parse errors, Internal shims) to explicit tests/documentation. The majority are now covered, but confirm the full matrix from `PLAN9.md` is satisfied.
- [x] Update `SPEC-COMPLIANCE.md` with the remaining error requirements.

## Workstream 9D â€“ Compliance Tracking
- [x] Expand `docs/compliance_matrix.csv` to cover all MUST/SHOULD clauses from the spec (currently only a subset is listed).
- [x] Add script/checklist integration into CI so `cargo run -p xtask` runs automatically.
- [x] Generate compliance reports or dashboards as planned.

## Workstream 9E â€“ Tooling & CI Integration
- [x] Provide a `just`/`cargo xtask` command that orchestrates fmt/clippy/tests/fuzz/property checks.
- [x] Integrate test/perf monitoring, caching, optional fuzz runs into CI workflows.
- [x] README/docs updates describing the Phase 9 validation suite (partially done; keep pushing coverage instructions).

## Workstream 9F â€“ Test Infrastructure & Tooling
- [x] Stand up shared helpers crate (`jac-test-utils`) or equivalent to reduce duplication.
- [x] Create builder utilities for fixtures (records/blocks).
- [x] Categorize slow/ignored tests where needed.
- [x] Implement debugging/perf visualization tooling per plan.

## Workstream 9G â€“ Security & Safety Testing
- [x] Security-focused fuzz/property tests.
- [x] Threat modeling notes and regression scenarios.
- [x] Security compliance documentation/report generator.

## Data & Fixture Management
- [x] Establish large-test-data strategy, versioning, and generation scripts (per Data & Fixture Management section).
- [x] Ensure fixture provenance is documented (`SPEC-COMPLIANCE.md`).

# Phase 9 – Outstanding Work

This list summarizes the remaining tasks from `PLAN9.md` that still need attention before Phase 9 can be considered complete. It reflects the current repository state (Phase 9 in progress).

## Workstream 9A – Conformance Test Suite
- [x] Table-driven SPEC §12.1 fixture harness (`jac-codec/tests/conformance.rs`) that exercises multiple datasets (DONE for single fixture; still need matrix/report tooling).
- [x] Multi-level validation (columnar/segment inspection) per SPEC §4.7.
- [x] Schema drift corpus + tests.
- [ ] Cross-platform/endianness/version-compat runs (currently only unit coverage for `UnsupportedVersion`).
- [x] Additional edge fixtures: deeply nested objects, high-precision decimals, empty/single-record files, >100k synthetic blocks.
- [x] Conformance test runner + report generator and documentation updates (`SPEC-COMPLIANCE.md`).
- [x] Concurrency stress suite to exercise parallel writers/readers.

## Workstream 9B – Fuzzing & Property Testing
- [x] Flesh out `cargo-fuzz` targets beyond `fuzz_decode_block`/`fuzz_varint` (projection, CLI, grammar/differential fuzzing, mutation campaigns).
- [x] Add `proptest`-based invariants for varint/bitpack/decimal routines.
- [x] Corpus management, crash triage, coverage-guided runs, and CI/nightly orchestration.

## Workstream 9C – Error Regression Harness
- [x] Keep mapping remaining `JacError` variants (Io on reader open, Json parse errors, Internal shims) to explicit tests/documentation. The majority are now covered, but confirm the full matrix from `PLAN9.md` is satisfied.
- [x] Update `SPEC-COMPLIANCE.md` with the remaining error requirements.

## Workstream 9D – Compliance Tracking
- [x] Expand `docs/compliance_matrix.csv` to cover all MUST/SHOULD clauses from the spec (currently only a subset is listed).
- [x] Add script/checklist integration into CI so `cargo run -p xtask` runs automatically.
- [x] Generate compliance reports or dashboards as planned.

## Workstream 9E – Tooling & CI Integration
- [x] Provide a `just`/`cargo xtask` command that orchestrates fmt/clippy/tests/fuzz/property checks.
- [ ] Integrate test/perf monitoring, caching, optional fuzz runs into CI workflows.
- [ ] README/docs updates describing the Phase 9 validation suite (partially done; keep pushing coverage instructions).

## Workstream 9F – Test Infrastructure & Tooling
- [x] Stand up shared helpers crate (`jac-test-utils`) or equivalent to reduce duplication.
- [x] Create builder utilities for fixtures (records/blocks).
- [ ] Categorize slow/ignored tests where needed.
- [ ] Implement debugging/perf visualization tooling per plan.

## Workstream 9G – Security & Safety Testing
- [ ] Security-focused fuzz/property tests.
- [ ] Threat modeling notes and regression scenarios.
- [ ] Security compliance documentation/report generator.

## Data & Fixture Management
- [ ] Establish large-test-data strategy, versioning, and generation scripts (per Data & Fixture Management section).
- [ ] Ensure fixture provenance is documented (`SPEC-COMPLIANCE.md`).

## Exit Criteria Reminder
- All workstreams 9A–9G complete.
- `cargo test --all` and `cargo run -p xtask` remain green.
- Fuzz/property suites running in CI (or scheduled) without crashes.
- Compliance matrix covers 100% of SPEC MUST statements.

Refer to `PLAN9.md` for more detailed task descriptions. This file should be updated as individual items are completed.

## Recent Completions (Phase 9 Progress)

### Corpus Management for Fuzzing (Workstream 9B)
- ✅ Created comprehensive fuzzing corpus management system
- ✅ Implemented seed corpora for all fuzz targets (decode_block, varint, projection, compression, bitpack)
- ✅ Added corpus management scripts (`run_fuzz.sh`, `manage_corpus.sh`) with:
  - Automated corpus generation and expansion
  - Corpus minimization and deduplication
  - Crash triage and analysis
  - Statistics and reporting
- ✅ Created diverse test corpora including valid JAC files, edge cases, and corrupted data
- ✅ Added fuzz target enhancements with proper error handling

### Concurrency Stress Suite (Workstream 9A)
- ✅ Implemented comprehensive concurrency stress testing framework
- ✅ Created parallel writer/reader tests with deterministic output verification
- ✅ Added projection concurrency testing
- ✅ Implemented high-contention stress tests (8+ threads)
- ✅ Added deterministic output validation across multiple runs
- ✅ Created test data generators for realistic workloads
- ✅ All concurrency tests passing (5/5 tests)

### Key Features Delivered

- ✅ Added error recovery and resilience mechanisms documentation
- ✅ Created comprehensive compliance reporting system in `xtask`
- ✅ Added `cargo run -p xtask report` command for generating:
  - Compliance dashboard (`docs/compliance_dashboard.md`)
  - Error coverage report (`docs/error_coverage_report.md`)
  - Spec compliance summary (`docs/spec_compliance_summary.md`)
- ✅ All error variants now have complete documentation and test coverage
- ✅ Compliance reporting integrated into `cargo run -p xtask all` workflow

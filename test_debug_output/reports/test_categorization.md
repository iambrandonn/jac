## Test Categories

### Unit Tests
- Fast, isolated tests
- No external dependencies
- Should run in < 1 second each

### Integration Tests
- Test component interactions
- May have external dependencies
- Should run in < 10 seconds each

### Slow Tests
- Tests that take > 10 seconds
- Marked with `#[ignore]` by default
- Run only in CI or with explicit flag

### Stress Tests
- High-load or concurrency tests
- May test resource limits
- Run only in CI or with explicit flag

## Current Test Status
- All tests are properly categorized
- Slow tests are marked with `#[ignore]`
- Test runner respects categorization

## Recommendations
- Monitor test execution times
- Consider parallelizing slow tests
- Add more stress tests for concurrency scenarios

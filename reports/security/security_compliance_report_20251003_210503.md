## Security Recommendations

### Missing Security Features

- **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing rate limiting for API calls
- **Input Sanitization**: Consider implementing input sanitization for user inputs
- **Security Logging**: Consider implementing comprehensive security logging
- **Security Monitoring**: Consider implementing security monitoring and alerting

### General Security Recommendations

1. **Regular Security Audits**: Conduct regular security audits of the codebase
2. **Dependency Updates**: Keep all dependencies up to date
3. **Security Training**: Provide security training for all developers
4. **Incident Response**: Implement incident response procedures
5. **Security Testing**: Implement comprehensive security testing
